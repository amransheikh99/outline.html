    <h4>Aims</h4>
    <p> This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills
         to build web applications using web technologies.
          You'll work individually and in teams to tackle 
          real-world web development challenges, building
           proficiency in selecting and applying suitable 
           tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential 
           aspects of security, ethics, accessibility, and 
           professional communication within web development.
            Guidance from an academic facilitator will support
             you in mastering both technical skills and 
             collaborative project management techniques 
             to achieve these objectives. </p>
